1.What is Microservice?
->Is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are -
Independently deployable
Loosly coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by small teams
Highly maintainable and testable

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.What is Monolith architechture?
->Monolith architechture is like a big container, where in all the software components of an app
assembled and tightly coupled, i.e each component is fully dependent on each other

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

3.What is the difference between Monolith and Microservvice?
->In Monolith architechture UI, API, SMS sending app, notifications app, authentication etc,
everything would be in one app, and everything was built together and deployed as a whole single project.
If there was one small change in one button, we should have built everything all over again and deploy it
->In Microservice architechture, UI is a different app, SMS sending is done by different app,
notification is managed by different app, authentication by other app, 
and they can be developed and maintained and deployed separately

4.Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
->We need it because it allows us to perform some side effects in our components,
like fetching data, timer.

5.What is Optional chaining?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.What is Shimmer UI?
->Shimmer : used to improve UX
Ref: https://tyler-technologies.github.io/design-guide-gallery/shimmer
Looks like layout of the actual content that is about to load.

7.What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?
->JS expression is any piece of code that resolves to single value
JS statement is any piece of code that does some action
Eg: 
//JS statements
let x=0;
function add(a,b) { return a+b };
if (true) { console.log(Hi); }
//JS expressions
x; // resolves to 0
3+x; // resolves to 3
add(1,2); / resolves to 3

8.What is conditional rendering? Explain with code example.
->In React, we can create multiple components which encapsulate behavior that we need.
After that, we can render them depending on some conditions or the state of our application.
In other words, based on one or several conditions, 
a component decides which elements it will return.
Example: 
function SignUp(props) {  
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;  
  if (isLoggedIn) {  
    return <UserLogin />;  
  }  
  return <GuestLogin />;  
} 
Here depending on isLoggedIn, what is to be rendered by the component is decided
i.e either <UserLogin/> or <GuestLogin/>

9.What is CORS?
->Ref : chapter-01 notes and assignment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.What is async and await?
->The async function declaration declares an async function 
where the await keyword is permitted within the function body

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.What is the use of 'const json = await data.json();' in getRestaurants()?
->The fetch() method returns a Promise representing the server's response,
and the response.json() resolves to the result of parsing the JSON response into a JavaScript object
Ref : https://reqbin.com/code/javascript/wc3qbk0b/javascript-fetch-json-example#:~:text=To%20fetch%20JSON%20from%20the,resolves%20with%20a%20JSON%20object.
